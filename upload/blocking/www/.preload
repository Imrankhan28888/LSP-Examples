-- Function ba.create.upload() requires an IO object. We use the 'home'
-- IO created by the wfs. An IO object can be created from another IO
-- object by using ba.mkio(). Modify the line below to suit your application.
-- uio (Upload IO) has the base set to the upload directory.
uio=ba.openio("home")
