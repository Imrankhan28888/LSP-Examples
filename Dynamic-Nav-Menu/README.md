This is the companion example for the [Dynamic Navigation Menu](https://makoserver.net/articles/Dynamic-Navigation-Menu) tutorial.

Run the example, using the Mako Server, as follows:

cd Dynamic-Nav-Menu
mako -l::www

http://localhost:portno, where portno is the HTTP port number used by
the Mako Server (printed in the console).
