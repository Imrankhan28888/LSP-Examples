# SMQ Cluster Example

This example shows how to set up an SMQ testing cluster similar to the
[online SMQ testing cluster](https://realtimelogic.com/IoT-LED-Cluster.html),
but you do not need anything but your own desktop computer. The
example shows how to simulate several computers on your own desktop
computer.

See the included [PDF document](README.pdf) for details.
