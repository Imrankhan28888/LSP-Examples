# Dynamic Navigation Menu

This is the companion example for the [HTML Forms and LSP for Beginners](https://makoserver.net/articles/HTML-Forms-and-LSP-for-Beginners) tutorial.

Run the example, using the Mako Server, as follows:

```
cd html-form
mako -l::www
```

See the [Mako Server command line video tutorial](https://youtu.be/vwQ52ZC5RRg) for more information on how to start the Mako Server.

After starting the Mako Server, use a browser and navigate to
http://localhost:portno, where portno is the HTTP port number used by
the Mako Server (printed in the console).

Enter any value in the login field and click the Login button.

Please note that the Mako Server (Barracuda App Server) includes advanced authentication and authorization management APIs and you would normally not create a login page as shown in this example. See the [authentication](../authentication) example for more information.
