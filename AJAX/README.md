# AJAX

This is the companion example for the [Ajax for Beginners](https://makoserver.net/articles/Ajax-for-Beginners) tutorial.

Run the example, using the Mako Server, as follows:

```
cd ajax
mako -l::www
```

See the [Mako Server command line video tutorial](https://youtu.be/vwQ52ZC5RRg) for more information on how to start the Mako Server.

After starting the Mako Server, use a browser and navigate to
http://localhost/. Enter some data into the input field and
watch the data being printed to the server's console and added to the
HTML page in the browser.
